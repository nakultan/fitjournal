# FitJournal — codebase guide

Personal, offline-first fitness journal. React 19 + TypeScript + Vite, shipped
as an installable PWA. **All data is on-device** (IndexedDB) — there is no
backend, no account, and no network dependency at runtime. See `README.md` for
the product overview.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — dev server with HMR
- `npm run build` — typecheck (`tsc -b`) then production build into `dist/`
- `npm test` — Vitest unit tests for the data & logic layer
- `npm run lint` · `npm run format` · `npm run typecheck`

Deployment is automatic: pushing to `main` runs `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`,
which builds and publishes to GitHub Pages.

## Architecture

Layers, each depending only on the layer below:

```
pages/ (screens)  →  components/ (UI kit)
        ↓
data/store  (React context — state, actions, persistence)
        ↓
data/logic + data/storage  (derived logic; IndexedDB persistence)
```

- **`data/types.ts`** — the entire data model. `AppData` is the single saved
  object; `SCHEMA_VERSION` is bumped for each schema change, paired with a
  migration step in `storage.ts`. An `ExerciseEntry` carries a `SetEntry[]` —
  one entry per logged set, each with its own reps and weight. A `Recipe`
  carries an optional downscaled `photo` (JPEG data-URL) and an optional
  per-serving `nutrition` block; `HealthData` carries the three original
  metrics plus five optional ones (active energy, exercise minutes, resting
  heart rate, body mass, sleep) handed in by the Apple Shortcut bridge.
- **`data/storage.ts`** — `loadData()` / `saveData()` / `defaultData()` /
  `exportData()` / `importData()` / `requestPersistentStorage()`. The journal
  lives in **IndexedDB**, so `loadData()` / `saveData()` are async; `loadData()`
  migrates an older `localStorage` journal across on first run, and both fall
  back to `localStorage` if IndexedDB is unavailable. Seeds Push/Pull/Legs
  templates on a fresh install; `importData()` validates a backup file before
  it can be restored; a versioned `MIGRATIONS` chain upgrades old saves and
  backups. `saveData()` returns `false` only if every storage tier fails, so a
  silent data loss can never look saved.
- **`data/logic.ts`** — *pure* derived computations: PRs, streaks (rest-day-
  aware, with a one-day grace), weekly & total stats, week-goal progress,
  session summaries, muscle balance, plateaus, insights/milestones, the
  activity heatmap, per-exercise history (`computeExerciseHistory`) with an
  Epley 1RM estimate (`estimate1RM`), and the cross-cutting helpers
  `findLastTime` / `formatSets`. **Nothing derived is ever stored** — it is
  always recomputed from `workouts`. This file and `storage.ts` have co-located
  `*.test.ts` suites (run with `npm test`); being pure makes them
  straightforward to unit-test.
- **`data/store.tsx`** — `StoreProvider` loads the journal (async — IndexedDB)
  and then mounts `StoreReady`, which holds `AppData` in React state, persists
  it on change (trailing-debounced ~400ms, and flushed immediately when the app
  is hidden or closed), and exposes typed actions that do immutable updates.
  The current `page` and viewed day come from the URL hash via `lib/router.ts`;
  the store also tracks `saveFailed` — true when the most recent persist failed.
  Undo-capable delete actions: `restoreExercise` / `restoreCardio` (Today),
  `restoreTemplate` (Plan), `restoreRecipe` (Recipes) — each re-inserts the
  deleted entry at its original index; `removeGoal` undo uses the existing
  `setGoal` action, capturing the old value in a closure before deletion.
- **`data/store-context.ts`** — `StoreContext`, the `useStore()` hook, and the
  `StoreValue` interface.

Components read state with `useStore()` and mutate only through store actions.

## Screens

`src/pages/` — one file per screen, each exporting a single `*Screen` component
(`TodayScreen`, `ProgressScreen`, `PlanScreen`, `RecipesScreen`,
`SettingsScreen`, plus two sub-pages: `SessionScreen` and
`ExerciseDetailScreen`). `ProgressScreen` carries an Overview / Exercises /
History segmented control — the merged home of the former Records and History
screens; the Overview also renders an *Apple Health* card with whatever
metrics have been synced, and the Exercises strength rows navigate to
`ExerciseDetailScreen`. `RecipesScreen` is a premium recipe keeper — sort
control, photo banner per card, a detail view with a hero photo, per-serving
macros, a serving scaler, checkable ingredients, and a full-screen Cook mode
that holds the screen awake. `SessionScreen` is the live in-workout view —
checkable set rows per exercise, with a rest-timer pill that fires the
`lib/feedback.ts` chime + haptic at zero; reached from the *Start* button on
Today (or the *Session* chip in Weight Lifting) and shares `ExerciseModal` /
`WorkoutSummaryModal` exported from `Today.tsx`. `ExerciseDetailScreen` shows
the top-set and Epley 1RM trend plus the session history for one exercise.
Modals and rows are local, unexported sub-components. `components/AppShell.tsx`
maps the active `page` to its screen and renders the sidebar; the bottom nav
still holds five items — Session and Exercise Detail are sub-pages reached by
action, not from the nav.

## Styling

- **Design tokens** live in `styles/tokens.css` (colour, spacing, type, radius,
  motion). **Never hardcode raw colours/sizes** — always use a `var(--…)` token.
  Theme-independent tokens (in `:root` only, not duplicated in light-theme
  blocks): `--color-brand-2` (#5e5ce6, logo gradient second stop),
  `--color-overlay` (rgba scrim behind modals), `--color-confetti-purple` and
  `--color-confetti-yellow` (extended confetti palette slots 4–5; slots 0–3 use
  the existing accent/success/warning/danger tokens).
- **Theming:** `tokens.css` carries a dark palette (the default) and a light
  palette. The theme follows the OS `prefers-color-scheme` unless an explicit
  `<html data-theme="light|dark">` overrides it — set by `lib/theme.ts` from the
  `theme` preference. The type scale is in `rem`, so it honors the OS text-size
  setting.
- `styles/components.css` styles the design-system components; `styles/app.css`
  styles the shell and screens. Every class is prefixed `fj-`.
  Touch targets: all `.fj-btn` carry `min-height: 44px` globally (not just in
  the mobile breakpoint). Reorder buttons (`.fj-reorder__btn`) are 44 × 32 px,
  clearing WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8. The session set-check (`.fj-session-check`) is
  44 × 44 px. Confetti piece colours are assigned via CSS classes
  (`.fj-confetti__piece--c0` … `--c5`) referencing tokens, not inline JS styles.
- Icons are **Lucide** (`lucide-react`). Emoji are reserved for celebratory
  moments only.
- **Responsive:** a single `@media (max-width: 768px)` block at the end of
  `app.css` / `components.css` holds the phone layout (bottom nav, bottom-sheet
  modals, `env(safe-area-inset-*)`). The desktop layout is the default.

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Strict TypeScript** (`verbatimModuleSyntax`, `noUnusedLocals`,
  `noUnusedParameters`, `erasableSyntaxOnly`): use `import type` for type-only
  imports; no `enum`s or namespaces.
- Path alias: `@/` resolves to `src/`.
- **`react-refresh/only-export-components`**: a `.tsx` file should export only
  components. Hooks, context and shared constants go in a separate `.ts` file —
  this is why `store-context.ts` and `components/toast-context.ts` exist.
- `vite.config.ts` sets `base` to `/fitjournal/` for production (the GitHub
  Pages sub-path) and `/` for local dev.
- Unique ids come from `lib/uid.ts`; `YYYY-MM-DD` date keys from `lib/dates.ts`.
- `lib/feedback.ts` is the feedback helper — `celebrate()` (a synthesised Web
  Audio chime plus a haptic buzz, for PRs and milestones) and `tap()` (a soft
  haptic, for everyday confirmations); both degrade silently and are safe to call.
- `lib/backup.ts` exposes `downloadBackup()` (the shared JSON-export helper
  used by Settings, the backup reminder, and the save-error banner) and
  `downloadCsv()` / `exportCsv()` (flatten the journal to a one-row-per-set
  CSV, with bodyweight, cardio, and day notes folded in).
- `lib/theme.ts` exposes `applyTheme()` — sets the `data-theme` attribute and a
  pre-paint localStorage hint that `index.html` reads to avoid a theme flash.
- `lib/router.ts` is a tiny hash router — `useRoute()` reads `location.hash` and
  `navigateTo(page, date?, exerciseKey?)` writes it. The store derives `page`,
  the viewed day, and the viewed exercise key from it, so the browser and
  Android back button work. Routes: `#/today/<date>`, `#/progress`, `#/plan`,
  `#/recipes`, `#/settings`, `#/session`, `#/exercise/<urlencoded-name>`. A
  bare `#/exercise` with no key is rewritten to Progress.
- `lib/image.ts` exposes `downscaleImage(file)` — recipe photos are read,
  resized so the longest edge ≤ 1280 px, and returned as a JPEG data-URL so the
  on-device journal and JSON backup stay small.
- `lib/healthBridge.ts` is the Apple Health bridge — `parseHealthPayload`
  validates a JSON payload (every field a finite number; junk is dropped),
  `readHealthFromURL` consumes a `?health=<json>` query parameter on first
  load then `history.replaceState`s it away so a reload cannot replay a stale
  import, and `buildLogWorkoutURL` builds a `shortcuts://run-shortcut?…` URL
  that opens a companion `FitJournalLogWorkout` Shortcut with the day's
  totals. The inbound parser is also used by the manual JSON file import in
  Settings.

## Data safety

On-device storage has no cloud backup; an IndexedDB record is effectively the
database, and `navigator.storage.persist()` is requested to keep it durable.

- **Export / Import** — Settings → Export writes a full JSON copy; Settings →
  Import restores one via `restoreData()`, behind a confirm step. A restore
  first auto-downloads a snapshot of the current data, so it can be undone.
- **`SaveErrorBanner`** — a persistent banner shown when a device write fails
  (the store's `saveFailed`); it urges an immediate export.
- **`BackupReminder`** — a calm, dismissible nudge to export, shown once there
  is data and the user has not backed up in three weeks (`lastBackupAt` tracks
  the last export). Both render globally from `App.tsx`.

## Project status

All five build phases are done, plus a Vitest suite over the data/logic
layer and five rounds of post-audit fixes. The original single-file app has
been retired to `../archive/`. OS-level scheduled reminders are deliberately
deferred — unreliable for an offline, server-less app.

Since the audit, the core has been re-modelled for **per-set logging**: an
`ExerciseEntry` holds a `SetEntry[]` (each set its own reps and weight),
`SCHEMA_VERSION` is `2` with a v1→v2 migration, and cardio personal records
rank on measured distance instead of a machine's calorie estimate.

The three retrospective screens (Progress, Records, History) have since been
merged into one Progress screen with an Overview / Exercises / History
segmented control; navigation now runs on a hash router (`lib/router.ts`), and
the Overview carries a body-weight trend chart.

Recipes is now a premium keeper — photos, optional per-serving macros, a
serving scaler that scales ingredient quantities with a leading number,
checkable ingredients, a focused full-screen Cook mode, and a sort control.
Apple Health is integrated via a Shortcut bridge (`lib/healthBridge.ts`): the
app stays a pure PWA, an iPhone Shortcut reads HealthKit and opens FitJournal
with `?health=<json>`, and the data lands on the Progress Overview.

A live in-workout **Session** view (`pages/Session.tsx`) renders today's
exercises as checkable set rows; checking a set starts a rest-timer pill that
chimes at zero. A new per-exercise **Detail** view (`pages/ExerciseDetail.tsx`)
shows top-set weight and an Epley 1RM estimate as Sparklines, plus the full
session history; reached by tapping any strength row in Progress → Exercises.
`Preferences.restTimerSeconds` (default 120) drives the timer length.

Polish round: an optional `Workout.note` (with a `setDayNote` action) shown
inline on Today, in History rows and in the workout summary; ▲/▼
`<ReorderButtons/>` on Today exercises and Plan template rows
(`reorderExercise` store action for the former, local moves for the latter);
a CSV export beside the JSON one in Settings; a calm 3-tap `<FirstRun/>`
modal mounted from `App.tsx`, gated by `Preferences.firstRunDismissed`;
hardened insight thresholds so sparse-data warnings stop misfiring; a
`<CountUp/>` component used on the post-workout summary stats; a
*Log to Health* button on the summary that opens a `FitJournalLogWorkout`
Shortcut with the day's totals; an *Apple Health · use* pill on the Today
weight banner that one-tap-fills the day's body weight from the last sync.

The post-strategy-review roadmap is complete — every Critical, Important and
Nice-to-have item from the review is shipped to production.

A UX audit (2026-05-23, commit 83c5514) applied Nielsen, Hick, Fitts,
cognitive load, progressive disclosure, Jakob, WCAG 2.2, and behavioral
reinforcement lenses across all 7 screens, producing a 29-item P0–P3
backlog tracked at `../UX-AUDIT.md`. P0 is shipped: reorder button touch
targets fixed (WCAG 2.5.8), Undo toasts extended to template/recipe/goal
deletes, four hardcoded-colour escapes resolved to tokens, and
`min-height: 44px` globalised on `.fj-btn`.

P1 is shipped (2026-05-23): `lastSavedAt` in store + a 6 px `.fj-save-dot`
ripple on `PageHeader` (P1.1); `GoalModal` exported and the ExerciseDetail
goal tile made a tappable button that opens it (P1.2); `Sparkline` gained a
`label?` prop — ExerciseDetail, body-weight trend, weekly bar chart, and
heatmap all carry `aria-label` summaries (P1.3); Cardio section on Today
collapses to an "+ Add cardio" affordance when no cardio logged (P1.4);
RecipeDetail section headings (Nutrition / Ingredients / Steps / Notes)
converted to `<h3 className="fj-detail-sub">` (P1.5); CookMode surfaces
"Screen stays on" / "Screen may dim" in its top bar via `wakeLockActive` /
`wakeLockDenied` state (P1.6); Today shows a `.fj-today-hero` "Ready to
train?" hero when the day is completely empty (P1.7); Plan shows an
`EmptyState` with a Create CTA when no templates exist (P1.8); rest-timer
pill buttons got `min-width/height: 44px` + a `<RotateCcw>` icon on +15s
(P1.9); `.fj-fav-btn::before` extends the star touch area to ≥44×44 (P1.10);
HistorySection reordered: Past workouts list comes first, heatmap below
(P1.11).

P2 — the real design round — is also shipped (2026-05-23). `Preferences.todayLayout`
(`'classic' | 'focused'`, default classic) drives Today's density: focused mode
collapses `WeightBanner` to a `.fj-add-row` "+ Body weight" button when no weight
is logged and no Apple Health prefill is available, keeps the cardio form hidden
even when cardio entries exist, and collapses the Day note to a "+ Day note"
affordance until tapped (P2.1). The Plan weekly schedule is rewritten as 7
tappable `<Card>` rows; each opens an `AssignDaySheet` modal listing "Rest day" +
every template as `.fj-assign-choice` rows (P2.2). Settings is now grouped cards
with deep-link hash routes — `lib/router.ts` carries a `SettingsSection` type
(`preferences | data | health | about`); `navigateTo(page, date, exerciseKey,
settingsSection?)` and the store's `viewSettings(section)` / `viewingSettingsSection`
write and read them. Default `#/settings` shows the cards index; each
`#/settings/<section>` renders just that section with a "Settings" back button
(P2.3). A new `<ResumeSessionPill/>` (mounted from `App.tsx`) floats above the
bottom nav on every screen except Today and Session when today already has
exercises (P2.4). Progress Overview hides the Weekly sets chart + Insights +
Muscle balance behind a single "Show charts, insights & muscle balance" toggle
whose state persists in `localStorage` (P2.5). `RecipeCard` got a
`.fj-recipe-card__cook` `<ChefHat>` button next to the favorite star (only when
`recipe.steps.length > 0`) that launches Cook mode straight from the grid; the
existing detail path still works (P2.6).

P3 — the polish round — is shipped (2026-05-24), closing the audit. `Modal` is
now a native `<dialog>` (`showModal()` / `close()`, `::backdrop` for the overlay,
free focus trap + Escape via the `cancel` event, mobile sheet preserved via
`margin: auto auto 0` + `fj-sheet-in` keyframe on `[open]`) — the manual focus
trap and `.fj-modal-overlay` wrapper are gone (P3.1). `data/logic.ts` exports
`WEIGHT_MAX = 2000` and `REPS_MAX = 200`; Session set rows, Today's
`ExerciseModal` set rows, and Progress' `GoalModal` target weight all carry a
`max` attribute + `aria-invalid` + a calm `.fj-input-warn` line ("That's a lot
of weight — double-check.") when exceeded — never blocking, just a typo
guardrail (P3.2). Settings → Your data now shows a `.fj-settings-meta` row
with "Auto-saved [relative time] · Last backup [date / never]" using a
`relativeTime()` helper (P3.3). A `<button className="fj-skip-link">` skip-to-content
link sits as the first child of `.fj-app`; it focus-traps to
`<main id="fj-main" tabIndex={-1}>` programmatically (button + `onClick`, not
`href="#fj-main"` — the hash router would parse that as a route) and is hidden
via `transform: translateY(-200%)` until `:focus` (P3.4). P3.5 (in-page Settings
anchor nav) was deliberately dropped — P2.3 already shipped grouped Settings
cards with deep-link routes, so the stopgap was redundant. Trust is reinforced
with a `.fj-settings-trust` strip (lock icon + "Everything stays on this device
— no account, no servers.") rendered under PageHeader on every Settings screen,
and the same strip placed in `FirstRun` between the intro and the unit/goal
fields (P3.6). Settings → About gained a discreet `<details className="fj-howto">`
"What's new" expander reusing the existing how-to pattern; lists the recent
user-visible additions (P3.7).
